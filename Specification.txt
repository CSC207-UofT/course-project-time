FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS
Schedule Making:
        EVENT VS TASK:
* Event is task with start and end time
* Task is just something to be done (todo list)


* How we want to use the feature:
   * Creating events (use case)
      * Event Class (entities)
         * Scheduled Events 
         * One-Time
         * info about event (i.e. name, time, location, etc.)
         * sub-task (todo-list)
   * Schedule Builder
      * will automatically schedule in times for event that you input
         * input estimated time needed and deadline
   * Time Tracking
      *    * View incomplete tasks (use case--view)
   * Auto Schedule Tasks
      * Input a (list of) task, the scheduler finds some time in your schedule to add that task
         * Prevent double booking
   * Export Schedule
      * Sharing (outputs ics file)
      * Multiple output formats
* CRC Cards:
   * User
      * username
      * Schedule fixedSchedule = new Schedule();
         * Availability
         * Optimal break time
         * Categorized time into periods of efficiency (level 1~4 ?)
