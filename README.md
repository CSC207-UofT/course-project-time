## Phase0 Things to Note

For phase 0, run ApplicationDriver.java, and you will be prompted for inputs to 
interact with our application. Note that several tasks and events have been created 
so that viewing all events and tasks will print something.

Our program prints a prompt indicating that there are six actions for users to choose from, 
but note that we have only implemented the first four. The rest are in progress!

See the phase0 folder for files related to phase0 submission and crcCards folder for our
crc model. You can also view the crc cards more easily on 
[this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YTfGWKZDEcyUZQwhMmWOKlNjJ1-Js9C3Dfnd-Lw-5Y4/edit) google doc!
