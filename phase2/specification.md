## Specification

This application helps users manage their time and schedule. 

The home page displayes to the user their scheduled events for the day and any tasks that have a deadline today. 

Another function that the application has is a calendar that manages the schedule of the user. The calendar displays all events, where events store a specific time of occurrence, along with the associated task. The user can indicate if the event is one-time or repeated. When viewing the events, the user can choose between a monthly view or a weekly view. 

There is a todo-list which stores all the tasks that the user wants to complete. Each task stores the task name, deadline, the duration needed for the task, along with a number of sub-tasks. The todo-list allows the user to indicate if the tasks are completed.

The application helps the user to auto-schedule a task into an event. When a task is clicked, its editing page is opened. Here the user is able to schedule a task as an event. Given a task in the todo-list, the application will find a suitable time from the calendar and suggest it to the user. Upon confirmation with the user, an event will be scheduled for the user to complete the task.

The user will also be able to reschedule an event if they did not end up completing the event in the scheduled time, or if they want to change a time for the event.

Furthermore, the application contains a notification system that notifies users when their events are about to begin so that the users do not miss their events, and when the tasks will be due. Users are able to set how long before the deadline should the notification be sent. Users can choose to be notified on their desktop or email, or both.

Lastly, there is be a pomodoro feature to help users work productively. The user will be able to select durations for "work time", and a "break time". Our program will then start timing and alternate between "work time" and "break time" for the user to work and take a break accordingly. The user is able to leave the pomodoro page without the timer stoping.
