## Phase1 Things to Note
Download and install gson jar from 
[here](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.9/jar).

For phase 1, run ApplicationDriver.java, and you will be prompted for inputs to 
interact with our application. 

Our program prints a prompt indicating that there are 10 actions for users to choose from.

Note that the json files will only be created when the `ApplicationDriver` stops running.

See `phase1/design-document.md` for our phase 1 report.
