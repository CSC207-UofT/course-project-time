During phase 2, I worked on the pomodoro timer and also the desktop notification presenter.

In these two pull requests, I worked on the pomodoro system. 
The first one was done with Xandar, which implemented most of the pomodoro system including error checking. However, it did not allow the user to leave and return to the pomodoro page without the timer restarting. This is fixed in the second pull request. Here, I created a system that saves where the user is at in the timer and when they return
to the pomodoro page, it calculates how much time has passed and whether they are now on a work or break interval. think these were both significant contributions as without them, the pomodoro feature would not be in the final project.

During phase 2, I worked on the pomodoro and settings pages in the GUI. Additionally, I added a system for exporting data from our calendar into an ICS file. I also worked on updates for serialization of notifications and setting. However, these changes were not connected to the front end.

In this pull request, in collaboration with Emily, I created a front end page for our Pomodoro clock, and implemented the logic for the clock's visuals. I think it demonstrates a significant contribution to the front end functionality of our program. I also worked collaboratively with Tahseen to develop the settings page.

My contributions to this pull request included the ICS serializer and the controllers/gateways that support it. I think my contributions to this PR demonstrate an implementation of a new feature across multiple layers of Clean Architecture.
