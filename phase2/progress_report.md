During phase 2, I worked on the pomodoro and settings pages in the GUI. Additionally, I added a system for exporting data from our calendar into an ICS file. I also worked on updates for serialization of notifications and setting. However, these changes were not connected to the front end.

In this pull request, in collaboration with Emily, I created a front end page for our Pomodoro clock, and implemented the logic for the clock's visuals. I think it demonstrates a significant contribution to the front end functionality of our program. I also worked collaboratively with Tahseen to develop the settings page.

My contributions to this pull request included the ICS serializer and the controllers/gateways that support it. I think my contributions to this PR demonstrate an implementation of a new feature across multiple layers of Clean Architecture.
