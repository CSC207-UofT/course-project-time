## Phase2 Things to Note

To run our program please use gradle. We used gradle to set up the dependencies of our project. To run the project with gradle in IntelliJ, open the gradle tool window, and select 'run', under application. Please do not try to run the individual files of the program, since the dependencies will not be included that way.

See `phase2/design-document.md` for our phase 2 report.
